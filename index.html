  <h2> Intro </h2>
  <h3> Who I am </h3>
      <p> My name is Lianna and I'm currently a software engineering student at Thinkful. I have a background in the retail and hospitality industries and I'm currently
        a stay-at-home mom to a toddler, but I'm ready to switch over to tech! I'm very excited to complete my course at Thinkful and hopefully work as a front end developer.  </p>
      
      <h3> Where I'm Located </h3>
      <p> I'm located in Central Florida. </p>

      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <h3> My Passion for Web Development </h3>
      <p> I have always enjoyed building websites with simple website builders like Wix and WordPress, but I decided I wanted to pursue this deeper and learn how to code!
      The way that the internet works fascinates me and I would love to be part of the process. I look forward to networking with other future and current developers,
      designers, and other people in the technology industry and hope to learn from and work with them one day. </p>
      <h3> My Other Interests </h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Traveling (I've been to 10 countries and hope to add many more to the list) </li>
        <li> Writing (For as long as I can remember, I've loved all kinds of forms of writing) </li>
        <li> Museums (Any time I'm in a new city or even have some spare time in my own, I love checking out museums) </li>
        <li> Reading (You can often find me in a library or bookstore) </li>
      </ol>
